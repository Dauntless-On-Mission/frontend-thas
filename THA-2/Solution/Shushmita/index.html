                    <p>We have deployed a search team equipped with some of our most talented wizards in the academy.
                        I will keep you posted on the results as the team has yet respond with results. However, I do
                        believe that most of the remaining horcruxes are located within your own school. Please let me know
                        if I could offer you any assistance in hunting them. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Looking forward to hearing from you about any updates regarding the horcruxes and wishing you the 
                        very best. 
                    </p>
